Functions are "self contained" [[Modules]] of code that accomplish a specific task.

Functions (also called 'procedures' in some programming languages and 'methods' in most object oriented programming languages) are **a set of instructions bundled together to achieve a specific outcome**. Functions are a good alternative to having repeating blocks of code in a program.
