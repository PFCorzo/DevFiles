A **web application** (or **web app**) is application software that runs on a web server, unlike computer-based software programs that are run locally on the operating system (OS) of the device. Web applications are accessed by the user through a web browser with an active network connection. These applications are programmed using a client–server modeled structure—the user ("_client_") is provided _services_ through an _off-site server_ that is hosted by a third-party.
