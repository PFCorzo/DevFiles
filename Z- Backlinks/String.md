In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), a **string** is traditionally a [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") of [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)"), either as a [literal constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_(computer_programming) "Literal (computer programming)") or as some kind of [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science) "Variable (computer science)"). The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally considered as a [data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type "Data type") and is often implemented as an [array data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure "Array data structure") of [bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte "Byte") (or [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture) "Word (computer architecture)")) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some [character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding"). _String_ may also denote more general [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type "Array data type") or other sequence (or [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type) "List (abstract data type)")) data types and structures.
