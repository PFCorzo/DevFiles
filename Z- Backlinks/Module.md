The defining characteristic of a **module** is information hiding. A module has an _interface_, which explicitly, but abstractly specifies both the functionality it provides as well as the functionality it depends on. (Often called the _exported_ and _imported_ functionality.) This interface has an _implementation_ (or multiple implementations, actually), which, from the user of a module are a black box.
