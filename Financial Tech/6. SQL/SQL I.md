# Introduction to SQL 
By the end of the unit we will know how to do the following: 
* Create a data object and relationship in the dataset
* Create Schemas, Tables, and Databases 
* Retrieve data using advanced database queries. 

## Postgres 

TLDR it's an open source database engine with great functionality. 

### PgAdmin 
[[pgAdmin]] is the management tool used for working with [[Postgres]]. It simplifies creation, maintance, and use of [[Database objects]].  

Once you are within pgAdmin you will have the option to create a server by right-clicking on the "sevrer" tab and selecting on "Create Server". When the server is created you will be now have a directory with an elephant icon that contains more directories within it. Three are granted at first: Database, Login/Group Roles, Tablespaces.
In the database directory you have two by default: ClassData, and postgres. In class data you have a schema called my container, and as we click on things you will see (on the right hand side) the SQL files change .
