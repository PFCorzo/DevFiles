# Lists, Dictionaries, 

### Lists 
A [[List]] is a variable that holds multiple values; the values within the key must be of the same [[Data Type]]. Note that if a the data type is a string, it must be surrounded by double quotes. 

#### Creating list in python 

To create a list in python, set a [[Variable]] and, after the equal sign, place closed bracket ```[]```, but within them, place the data type followed by a comma. 

Example for list with FLT and INT data types: 
```
car_milage_on_2010_vehicles = [140000, 160000, 100000, 98000]
```

Example for list with STR data types: 
```
fictional_animals = ["Dragons", "Bears", "Tigers"] 
```

### Dictionaries 
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
