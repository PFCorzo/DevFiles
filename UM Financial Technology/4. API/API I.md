# APIs 
We will be discussing: 
* What is a [[Client-Server Model]] 
* How to read documentation and identify [[Endpoint]] from a given API 
* How to perform [[GET Request]]s and view the [[JSON]] response using the Postman client
* Interpret that JSON structure from a GET request response 
* Use the Request library to request JSON data from an API with Python 
* [[Parse]] a JSON response and print a selected field using Python 
* [[Query]] an API using [[URL Parameters]] with the Request libraries 

There are two type of APIs 

#### Api
Application Programming Interfaces ([[API]]s) are a set of [[Functions]] packaged together that provide developers with a means of communicating with a server and integrating third-party software and technology into new applications. It is a type of software [[Interface]] that offers a service to other pieces of [[Software]]. 

In contrast to a [[User Interface]] that connect a computer to a person, an application programming interface connect computer or pieces of software to each other. It is not inted to be used by the [[End User]] other than the [[Computer Programmer]] who is incorporating it into the software. 

Typically, when you want to learn how to build or use a connection or interface, you will read a [[API Specification]]. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. 

#### Web APIs

The term API is also used commonly when referring to a [[WebAPI]] which allow communication between computers that are joined by the internet. 

## Using WebAPIs

#### API Gateways 

An API gateway is an API management tool that sits between a [[Client]] and a collection of backend services(typically located in a server). An API gateway acts as a reverse [[Proxy]] to accept all  [[API calls]], aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result.
