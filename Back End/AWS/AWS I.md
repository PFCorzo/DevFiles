# Unsupervised Learning 
## The CLoud Toolbox 
* [[Amazon Sagemaker]]
Sagemaker is used to deploy Machine Learning models. 
* [[Amazon Lex]]
To create conversational interfaces(chat-box and stuff)
* [[Amazon S3]] 
To store files in the cloud. 
* [[AWS Lambda]]
Is used to create serverless applications. 

## Unsupervised learning 
Remember that [[Supervised Learning]] deal with Inputs of [[Labled Data]] and its goal is predict a class or value, but [[Unsupervised Data]]'s input consists of [[Unlabeled Data]] to find patterns or group data.

## Application of Unsupervised Learning 

### Clustering 
In an Unsupervised Learning program, [[Clustering]] allows automatic splitting of the dataset into groups according to similarity. It can be used segmentation and targeting. 

### Anomaly Detection 
In an Unsupervised Learning program, [[Anomaly Detection]] is made possible because it automatically discover unusual data points in a dataset. It has been used for the identification of fraudulent transactions, discovering fault pieces of hardware, and identifying on outlier caused by a human error during data entry. 

## The K-Means Algorithm 

The [[K-Means Algorithm]] is a method of vector quantization 

## Principal Component Analysis 
[[Principal Component Analysis]] is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, making it easier to understand, but at the same time minimizing information loss. 
It is done by creating new uncorrelated variable that successively maximize variance. [](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2015.0202)
