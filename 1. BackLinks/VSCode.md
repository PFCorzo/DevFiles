### VS Code

Oh, the power of VS Code! A little program that does so much!

Visual Studio (VS) Code is a free text editor that runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems. For developers, text editors are like cozy pillows on which they rest their heads.

At a fundamental level, programming is all about creating text in files with various extensions. When we create a block of HTML like the one below, what we've really done is create a block of text. There are some funny symbols in there, but at its most basic level, it's just text.

For a simple text editor, this is where the comprehension stops: our block of HTML remains a block of text. But for more powerful text editors like VS Code, these blocks of text are immediately recognized as code (as long as we include the right file extension). VS Code can provide a more visually intuitive understanding of the code through indicative coloring, smart tabs, and autocomplete functionality. As a result, creating HTML is a more natural process, and the HTML can be debugged more quickly.
