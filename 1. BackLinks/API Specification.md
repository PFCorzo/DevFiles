API documentation[](https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2) is essentially the reference manual for an API – It tells API consumers how to use the API. API documentation is meant for humans, usually developers, to read and understand. Providing documentation that is well-designed, comprehensive, and easy to follow is crucial when it comes to ensuring developers have a great experience with the API. And a great developer experience (DX) means a better chance for API success. If developers can’t follow your API documentation, they’ll likely find another API with better documentation and would be easier to integrate. Good documentation also helps decrease the time it takes to onboard new API consumers. If developers have all the information they need to use your API, then they don’t have to send your company emails, call your customer service department, or submit posts in forums to get help.
