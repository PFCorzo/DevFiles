## 6.3 Classical decomposition[](https://otexts.com/fpp2/classical-decomposition.html#classical-decomposition)

The classical decomposition method originated in the 1920s. It is a relatively simple procedure, and forms the starting point for most other methods of time series decomposition. There are two forms of classical decomposition: an additive decomposition and a multiplicative decomposition. These are described below for a time series with seasonal period m

(e.g., m=4 for quarterly data, m=12 for monthly data, m=7

for daily data with a weekly pattern).

In classical decomposition, we assume that the seasonal component is constant from year to year. For multiplicative seasonality, the m

values that form the seasonal component are sometimes called the “seasonal indices.”
