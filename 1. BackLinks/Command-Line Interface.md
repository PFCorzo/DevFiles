A **command-line interface** (**CLI**) processes [commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing) "Command (computing)") to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a **command-line interpreter** or **command-line processor**. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing) "Shell (computing)") for interactive access to operating system functions or services. Such access was primarily provided to users by [computer terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal "Computer terminal") starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on [VAX/VMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS "OpenVMS"), [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix") systems and personal computer systems including [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS "DOS"), [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M "CP/M") and [Apple DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS "Apple DOS").
