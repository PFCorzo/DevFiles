A notebook _kernel_ is a “computational engine” that executes the code contained in a [Notebook document](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html#notebook-document). The _ipython kernel_, referenced in this guide, executes python code. Kernels for many other languages exist ([official kernels](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#kernels)).

When you open a [Notebook document](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html#notebook-document), the associated _kernel_ is automatically launched. When the notebook is _executed_ (either cell-by-cell or with menu _Cell -> Run All_), the _kernel_ performs the computation and produces the results. Depending on the type of computations, the _kernel_ may consume significant CPU and RAM. Note that the RAM is not released until the _kernel_ is shut-down.
